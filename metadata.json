    "Title": "Molecular fingerprint maps based on broadly learned knowledge-based representations",
    "Description": "Molecular representation of small molecules via ingerprint-based molecular maps (images). Typically, the goal is to use these images as inputs for an image-based deep learning model such as a convolutional neural network. The authors have demonstrated high performance of MolMap out-of-the-box with a broad range of tasks from MoleculeNet.\n",
